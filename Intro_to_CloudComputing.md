###  Here is a introduction to cloud computing and how it is been used and in this growing technology world. Before proceeding there might be a question..
# What is Cloud?
> "Cloud" refers to the server which is accessed over the internet and also the software and databases that run those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world.

Basically cloud enables the users to access the same files and application from any device as computing and storage takes place on servers in a data center, instead of locally. Let's take an example if we break a phone or taking a new mobile we want our previous data, photos,etc. we must have a backup of it. To access it by internet we have cloud storage provider like *Google Drive*, *Google Photos*, *Dropbox*.
This is more power for the businesses or startup as it removes some IT cost like no need to update or maintainance of servers as cloud vendor take care of it. Whereas for startup company or small business they can't afford their own infrastructure so they can outsource infrastructure needs via cloud.

## How does Cloud Computing Work?
Cloud computing is possible because of technology called virtualization. It allows for the creation of simulated, digital-only "virtual" computer, behaves as if it were a physical computer with it's hardware.
Let's take a example if we want a high end game to play we just need only high speed internet and don't need to worry about the high end storage as it is possible by cloud.
Users can access to the cloud services either by browser or through an app, connecting to the cloud over the internet.
##  Main service models of cloud computing

* **Software-as-a-Service(SaaS):** Here users don't need to install application on their machine, SaaS provides application hosted on cloud where users access them over the internet. SaaS is like renting the house, where landlord maintains the house, but tenant mostly gets to use it as if they owned it.
* **Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS):** PaaS vendors offer everything necessary for building application, includes development tools, infrastructure, and operating system, over the internet. It can be compared as renting tools.
* **Infrastructure-as-a-tool:** Here company rents the servers and storage they need from a cloud provider. Iaas is like a company leasing the plot of land where they can build whatever they want, but need to provide their own building equipments and materials.
* **Function-as-a-Service:** Faas also known as serverless computing, breaks cloud application down even in smaller components that only run when needed. They are so called "serverless" as they don't run on  dedicated machines and so the companies don't have to manage any servers.
##### As above model discussed there are different types of cloud deployment
## Different types of Cloud deployment
1. **Private Cloud:** It is a server, data center, or distributed network wholly dedicated to one organization.

2. **Public Cloud:** A public cloud is a service run by an external vendor that may include servers in one or multiple data centers. Unlike a private cloud, public clouds are shared by multiple organizations. Using virtual machines, individual servers may be shared by different companies, a situation that is called "multitenancy" because multiple tenants are renting server space within the same server.

3. **Hybrid Cloud:** Hybrid cloud deployments combine public and private clouds, and may even include on-premises legacy servers. An organization may use their private cloud for some services and their public cloud for others, or they may use the public cloud as backup for their private cloud.

4. **Multicloud:** Multicloud is a type of cloud deployment that involves using multiple public clouds. In other words, an organization with a multicloud deployment rents virtual servers and services from several external vendors – to continue the analogy used above, this is like leasing several adjacent plots of land from different landlords. Multicloud deployments can also be hybrid cloud, and vice versa.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
* High speed.
* Back-up and restore data.
* Reliability.
* Mobility.
* Cost savings.
* Unlimited Storage Capacity.
* Automatic software integration.
